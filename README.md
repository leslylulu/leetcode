# LeetCode Solutions

This is my personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions. I'm gradually building this repository as I work through problems to strengthen my algorithmic thinking and coding skills.

## Why This Repository

Regular practice with algorithms and data structures is key to becoming a better programmer. This repository serves as:

1. A personal reference for solutions I've implemented
2. A way to track progress over time
3. A resource to revisit and reinforce concepts

## Organization

Solutions are organized by common problem categories:
- Array Problems
- Linked List Problems
- String Problems
- Tree Problems
- Two Pointers Problems
- Hash Table Problems

## My Approach

I believe in understanding the underlying principles rather than memorizing solutions. For each problem, I try to:

- Understand the problem thoroughly
- Think about multiple approaches
- Implement a working solution
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Refine the solution when possible

## Next Steps

As I continue this journey, I'll:
- Add more problems across different categories
- Include multiple approaches when relevant
- Enhance documentation with key insights
- Focus on building pattern recognition

Remember: Consistency is more important than intensity. Small, regular practice yields better results than occasional cramming.
