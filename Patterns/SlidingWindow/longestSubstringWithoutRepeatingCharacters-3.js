Hint
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

/**
 * a lot of variables are fine and those are necessary
 * Not good(Try to avoid): I also started comparing from s[0] and s[1], which led to some confusion and edge cases.
 * my sliding window idea was correct â€” I just needed to clean up the logic a bit
